# Trivia

## Overview

Mobile app built using TypeScript, React Native (Native CLI), and Redux. The app allows users to play trivia games using open trivia API. Each round includes 5 questions from various categories and difficulties. Also, questions are received in an encoded format (HTML Codes) so they are decoded in order to display correctly to the users, and the incorrect answers are received separately from the correct answer, Hence I created an array including both and shuffled it to randomize the index of the correct answer for each question.
